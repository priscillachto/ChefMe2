        <h2> Design Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
            College often represents the transition into adulthood. Young adults are challenged to take care of themselves as they move out to live away from their families. Beyond studying and socializing, they are now also responsible for their living necessities like cooking. However, because cooking is not specifically taught in school, students often struggle to cook for themselves.

            WHAT IS BRACKETS?
        -->
        <p>
            With limited cooking knowledge and skills, students often resort to take outs, meal prep subscriptions or frozen microwavable meals, which is not the most economical or healthy for students. Though there are a lot of resources online to help student with cooking, like youtube videos or recipes, the act of having to look up a recipe online might not be the most convenient and efficient for busy college students.

        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Secondary Research 01</strong> </p>
        <p>
            The article “Can’t cook, won’t cook? A tenth of students never made their own food” (Denham, 2013) highlights the issue with the limited cooking knowledge of college students. Research done by studentbeans.com shows that 65% students skip breakfast, 59% students skip lunch and 29% students skip dinner each week, illustrating the bad eating habits of college students. This bad habit is in fact due to the lack of cooking education as James Eder, the founder of studentbeans, said “Over half of students wish they’d learnt to cook at school and therefore go off to uni with limited cooking know-how.” Students expressed that they tend to stick with just a few safe recipes while other relies heavily on take outs or food from home.

            <center><em>“I find cooking for myself quite empowering. There’s a real sense of achievement when you cook something particularly good or impressive to show off either at a party or in front of housemates. I also like being able to eat as much as I want, when I want!”</em> - Jonny (21), Durham University </center>

            Another research claims that 1 in 3 college students don’t know how to boil an egg, while 1 in 5 can barely make toast (Daily Mail Reporter, 2012). A spokesperson from Sainsbury expresses that “students heading off to college this month need a crash course as to how to set themselves up for their new lives”. The study also shows that 48% student will be hungry during their first term because they are unable to make even a simple dish like spaghetti bolognese while a third are bemused by baking a potato.

         <center><em>“I learned how to cook in college through talking to my friends, asking them what their favorite recipe is. I also cook with my housemates a lot, that is how I started to cook. Now I love cooking!”

         <center><em>“As a college student who just moved out from the dorms, I didn’t know how to make a lot of dishes. The first month, I was eating the same thing every meal! But I started seeing what my friends are making on their social media so I asked them for the recipes. That’s how I accumulated my collection of recipes”

        <h3> Summary </h3>
        <p>The major issue with living alone for the first time is the lack of cooking knowledge and skill. Though there are lots of resources online, the resources are often not user friendly or consolidated, making it complicated or even confusing to use. College students expressed their interest in learning how to cook, yet they need a tool to help them get started. ChefMe is the solution. It is an app that allows user to explore different recipes and follow simple instructions with video guide to help them start their cooking journey and gain cooking knowledge and skills. ChefMe also aims to create a community that connects its users through the exploration of food and cooking. Users can share their passion for cooking through interacting with other users, exchanging knowledge to further their cooking techniques. </p>

            THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT
        -->
        <h3>Quick Edit for CSS and JavaScript</h3>
        <p>
            No more switching between documents and losing your context. When editing HTML, use the
            <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl + E</kbd> shortcut to open a quick inline editor that displays all the related CSS.
            Make a tweak to your CSS, hit <kbd>ESC</kbd> and you're back to editing HTML, or just leave the
            CSS rules open and they'll become part of your HTML editor. If you hit <kbd>ESC</kbd> outside of
            a quick inline editor, they'll all collapse. Quick Edit will also find rules defined in LESS and
            SCSS files, including nested rules.
        </p>
        
        <samp>
            Want to see it in action? Place your cursor on the <!-- <samp> --> tag above and press
            <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl + E</kbd>. You should see a CSS quick editor appear above, showing the CSS rule that
            applies to it. Quick Edit works in class and id attributes as well. You can use it with your
            LESS and SCSS files also.
            
            You can create new rules the same way. Click in one of the <!-- <p> --> tags above and press
            <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl + E</kbd>. There are no rules for it right now, but you can click the New Rule
            button to add a new rule for <!-- <p> -->.
        </samp>
        
        <a href="screenshots/quick-edit.png">
            <img alt="A screenshot showing CSS Quick Edit" src="screenshots/quick-edit.png" />
        </a>
        
        <p>
            You can use the same shortcut to edit other things as well - like functions in JavaScript,
            colors, and animation timing functions - and we're adding more and more all the time.
        </p>
        <p>
            For now inline editors cannot be nested, so you can only use Quick Edit while the cursor
            is in a "full size" editor.
        </p>
        
        <!--
            LIVE PREVIEW
        -->
        <h3>Preview HTML and CSS changes live in the browser</h3>
        <p>
            You know that "save/reload dance" we've been doing for years? The one where you make changes in
            your editor, hit save, switch to the browser and then refresh to finally see the result?
            With Brackets, you don't have to do that dance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Brackets will open a <em>live connection</em> to your local browser and push HTML and CSS updates as you
            type! You might already be doing something like this today with browser-based tools, but with Brackets
            there is no need to copy and paste the final code back into the editor. Your code runs in the
            browser, but lives in your editor!
        </p>
        
        <h3>Live Highlight HTML elements and CSS rules</h3>
        <p>
            Brackets makes it easy to see how your changes in HTML and CSS will affect the page. When your cursor
            is on a CSS rule, Brackets will highlight all affected elements in the browser. Similarly, when editing
            an HTML file, Brackets will highlight the corresponding HTML elements in the browser.
        </p>
        
        <samp>
            If you have Google Chrome installed, you can try this out yourself. Click on the lightning bolt
            icon in the top right corner of your Brackets window or hit <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl + Alt + P</kbd>. When
            Live Preview is enabled on an HTML document, all linked CSS documents can be edited in real-time.
            The icon will change from gray to gold when Brackets establishes a connection to your browser.
            
            Now, place your cursor on the <!-- <img> --> tag above. Notice the blue highlight that appears
            around the image in Chrome. Next, use <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl + E</kbd> to open up the defined CSS rules.
            Try changing the size of the border from 10px to 20px or change the background
            color from "transparent" to "hotpink". If you have Brackets and your browser running side-by-side, you
            will see your changes instantly reflected in your browser. Cool, right?
        </samp>
        
        <p class="note">
            Today, Brackets only supports Live Preview for HTML and CSS. However, in the current version, changes to
            JavaScript files are automatically reloaded when you save. We are currently working on Live Preview
            support for JavaScript. Live previews are also only possible with Google Chrome, but we hope
            to bring this functionality to all major browsers in the future.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Quick View</h3>
        <p>
            For those of us who haven't yet memorized the color equivalents for HEX or RGB values, Brackets makes
            it quick and easy to see exactly what color is being used. In either CSS or HTML, simply hover over any
            color value or gradient and Brackets will display a preview of that color/gradient automatically. The
            same goes for images: simply hover over the image link in the Brackets editor and it will display a
            thumbnail preview of that image.
        </p>
        
        <samp>
            To try out Quick View for yourself, place your cursor on the <!-- <body> --> tag at the top of this
            document and press <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl + E</kbd> to open a CSS quick editor. Now simply hover over any of the
            color values within the CSS. You can also see it in action on gradients by opening a CSS quick editor
            on the <!-- <html> --> tag and hovering over any of the background image values. To try out the image
            preview, place your cursor over the screenshot image included earlier in this document.
        </samp>
        
        <h3>Need something else? Try an extension!</h3>
        <p>
            In addition to all the goodness that's built into Brackets, our large and growing community of
            extension developers has built hundreds of extensions that add useful functionality. If there's
            something you need that Brackets doesn't offer, more than likely someone has built an extension for
            it. To browse or search the list of available extensions, choose <strong>File > Extension
            Manager…</strong> and click on the "Available" tab. When you find an extension you want, just click
            the "Install" button next to it.
        </p>
