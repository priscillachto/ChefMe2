        <p>
            College often represents the transition into adulthood. Young adults are challenged to take care of themselves as they move out to live away from their families. Beyond studying and socializing, they are now also responsible for their living necessities like cooking. However, because cooking is not specifically taught in school, students often struggle to cook for themselves.

        <p>
            With limited cooking knowledge and skills, students often resort to take outs, meal prep subscriptions or frozen microwavable meals, which is not the most economical or healthy for students. Though there are a lot of resources online to help student with cooking, like youtube videos or recipes, the act of having to look up a recipe online might not be the most convenient and efficient for busy college students.

            <strong>Secondary Research 01</strong> </p>
        <p>
            The article “Can’t cook, won’t cook? A tenth of students never made their own food” (Denham, 2013) highlights the issue with the limited cooking knowledge of college students. Research done by studentbeans.com shows that 65% students skip breakfast, 59% students skip lunch and 29% students skip dinner each week, illustrating the bad eating habits of college students. This bad habit is in fact due to the lack of cooking education as James Eder, the founder of studentbeans, said “Over half of students wish they’d learnt to cook at school and therefore go off to uni with limited cooking know-how.” Students expressed that they tend to stick with just a few safe recipes while other relies heavily on take outs or food from home.

            <center><em>“I find cooking for myself quite empowering. There’s a real sense of achievement when you cook something particularly good or impressive to show off either at a party or in front of housemates. I also like being able to eat as much as I want, when I want!”</em> - Jonny (21), Durham University </center>

            Another research claims that 1 in 3 college students don’t know how to boil an egg, while 1 in 5 can barely make toast (Daily Mail Reporter, 2012). A spokesperson from Sainsbury expresses that “students heading off to college this month need a crash course as to how to set themselves up for their new lives”. The study also shows that 48% student will be hungry during their first term because they are unable to make even a simple dish like spaghetti bolognese while a third are bemused by baking a potato.

         <center><em>“As a college student who just moved out from the dorms, I didn’t know how to make a lot of dishes. The first month, I was eating the same thing every meal! But I started seeing what my friends are making on their social media so I asked them for the recipes. That’s how I accumulated my collection of recipes”
